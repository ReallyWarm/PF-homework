# Whirling Fan
The fan spins at n revolutions/second. When turned off the switch, the fan speed is reduced by 80 percent every three seconds, 
and when the fan speed is less than 0.5 revolutions/second, the fan spins one more cycle and stops. Write a program that takes 
an input number of n, finds the duration until the fan stops spinning, and how many revolutions the fan spin. as for an example 
of how the program works.

| n = 10                       | n = 20                        | n = 40                        |
| duration time = 42 seconds   | duration time  = 51 seconds   | duration time  = 60 seconds   |
| whirling about 144 rounds    | whirling about 294 rounds     | whirling about 594 rounds     |
